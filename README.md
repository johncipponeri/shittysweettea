# Do you want to avoid shitty sweet tea?
> As a person who doesn't drink soda, I find myself defaulting to sweet tea at every restaurant, if you're like me, and you don't drink soda, or you cant, you may find yourself with few options when you go out. Our mission at shitty sweet tea is to encourage restaurants to provide higher quality sweet tea for those of us who have nothing else

Raising Cane's 🍃🍃🍃🍃🍃

Raising Cane's is the star in the nightsky that led the wise man to sweet baby Jesus.

Raising Cane's set the standard which all other restaurants should strive for.

> I bought a gallon of your sweet necture to take home with me.
>
> I sleep with the jug.
>
> I cuddle the jug.
>
> I shower with it; pouring a tiny bit on my body and giggling to my self.
>
> No one can ever take you from meeeeeeee 🎼🎵🎶

## Outback Steakhouse 🍃🍃

To the charlatans at Outback Steakhouse:

> Your sweet tea is uninspired

> I give it to tea leaves

## Applebee's 🍃

> lacking in both sweetness and tea flavor it tastes like a vague memory, i imagine this is what the main character from memento thinks of when he thinks about sweet tea
