# Do you want to avoid shitty sweet tea?
> As a person who doesn't drink soda, I find myself defaulting to sweet tea at every restaurant, if you're like me, and you don't drink soda, or you cant, you may find yourself with few options when you go out. Our mission at shitty sweet tea is to encourage restaurants to provide higher quality sweet tea for those of us who have nothing else

> lacking in both sweetness and tea flavor it tastes like a vague memory, i imagine this is what the main character from memento thinks of when he thinks about sweet tea
